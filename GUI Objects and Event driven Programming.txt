Each year, more and more people are moving to online shopping for their Christmas gifts (this year especially!).  The trouble is,  when browsing so many websites, it can be difficult to keep track of gift ideas and where you saw them.  Your task today is to develop an application that will help a user to keep track of potential Christmas gifts.  The application should accept the recipient name, gift idea and a URL for that gift from the user and store them in an appropriate data structure (array or ArrayList of objects).  The application should have a full swing user GUI and allow the user to add gift ideas, delete gift ideas, display all gift ideas, and search for a gift by recipient name.
